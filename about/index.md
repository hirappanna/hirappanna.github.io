Hira Lesea is an avid food lover who, when cooking, embodies the Italian idea of 'Il Cuoco' or 'The Cook.’ In Italy, meals cooked in the home, opposed to in a restaurant, are so superlative and unpretentious that 'Il Cuoco' is held in higher regard than that of 'Il Chef'. This idea resonated with Hira when she studied at the [University of Gastronomic Sciences](http://www.unisg.it/en/) in Italy, also known as the 'Slow Food' school. There she learned about subtleties of flavor and pleasure as well as history, culture and science of food. Hira’s training has also been influenced from an internship at Alice Waters' Chez Panisse under the guidance of renowned chef David Tanis, who taught her about simplicity and quality. Hira’s knowledge of food and cooking has been further expanded by studies of the ancient Indian medicine Ayurveda, in both Kerala, India and New York City which guides her preparations to be both vibrant and ridiculously delicious.

She’s had the pleasure of working on retreats for the past four years at [Seven Arrows East](http://sevenarrowseast.com) and other centers and through this work has gleaned a tremendous amount of knowledge and wisdom that isn’t usually found in a commercial kitchen. She sees food as not solely fuel for the body’s machinery but as an essential and integral part of the retreat experience. People need to feel nurtured, nourished and eat food that's easy to digest and prepared with serious love. When all of these aspects are present, retreatants are able to soften, relax, and enjoy deeper healing through their physical and spiritual practices. She believes in a world where eating is transformative and most of all, transcendental.

In addition to her studies in culinary arts, Hira holds a E-RYT 500 hour certificate under the auspices of Leigh Evans and Summer Quashie’s unprecedented program- [Yoga Sukhavati](http://leighevansyoga.com) and is a Buddhist practitioner. Through this unique lense she brings her service, attention and intentions to the table.
