I accommodate any dietary requests or restrictions. All meals are generally vegetarian and can be made dairy free, gluten free or vegan. I source produce from farms in the vicinity of retreat centers and utilize only organic vegetables and fruit when available, organic dairy and free range eggs. Raw, sprouted and fermented foods are available, as well as pasture raised meat and/or sustainably caught fish, all upon request. Service is family style and high touch and meal presentation includes useful information about nutrition from an Ayurvedic perspective as well as Traditional Chinese Medicine.
